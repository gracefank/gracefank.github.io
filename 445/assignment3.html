				<h2>Assignment 3</h2>
				<p>
					The three most used high-level media from the collection are television, the internet, and the radio. Within television, many people watch sports, the news, and comedy shows. While watching sports and comedy shows is a similarity between 2004 and 2019, watching news is not. This trend has likely changed because either people are less concerned with the news or they have news apps on their phone. It is interesting to note that some shows are still being aired 15 years later, such as Family Guy, The Bachelor, and the Daily Show. One media that was particularly interesting was the use of TiVo, which is not something anyone really uses now. This change is because most of the shows we are used to watching are available online now, whether through subscription or for free. Therefore, there is no need to pre-record a show.
				</p>
				<p> 
					While both generations listen to the radio, there is a significantly higher number of people listening in 2004. The advent of the smart phone definitely changed this. Before, people either listened to the radio in their car or had physical discs, which limited the songs they could play. Now, people can use Bluetooth to connect their phones and music apps, most commonly Spotify, to stream music. 
				</p>
				<p>
					The internet was used a lot for instant messaging and playing video games. While instant messaging is very popular now, the different platforms which we do it on is different. For example, people in 2004 used MSN, Yahoo, and AIM for chatting on the computer. Now, the most popular mobile apps are Facebook Messenger, WhatsApp, and regular texting. The smart phone really changed a lot of these processes and media into something more accessible on a regular basis. 
				</p>
				<p>
					Some other media that is not outdated includes the GameCube, iPod, DVD, and newspaper. There are now alternative ways to play video games, listen to music, watch movies, and even read the news. There are also different video games, different music, and different movies that people are interested in and it is up to those companies to keep up with trends or become obsolete.
