                    Save The Cake's founder, Susan Sarich, grew up in Chicago, where she was called Susie by her grandmothers, Mildred and Madeline.
                </h4>
                <p>
                    Every day Susie would come home from school to enjoy her grandmothers’ company over a glass of milk and a fresh baked treat. This daily baking ritual and special time together in the kitchen left a lasting impression. Cake has the unique ability to connect us with the people and events of our past. However, cake should not be reserved only for these special occasions. A delicious slice of cake can immediately bring a bit of celebration to an ordinary day.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When Susie grew up to become Susan and moved to the West Coast, she brought along her grandmothers’ carefully recorded recipes on handwritten 3×5 cards. The pure and simple connection those recipes fostered helped Susan form Save The Cake to share her experience with others.
