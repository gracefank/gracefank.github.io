			<h1>Hammes Filter Subscription Service</h1>
			<h2>An AC filter subscription service to help private homeowners reduce property costs</h2>	

			<p>Timeframe: February – May 2020</p>
			<p>Role: Designer &amp; Front-end Lead</p>
			<p>Tools: Figma, React, SASS, Flask</p>

			<h3>01 Project Context</h3>
			<p> 
				AC units require regular filter changes to preserve their lifespan. However, as temporary residents, tenants are less motivated to perform upkeep on their unit. 
				Creating an online system to regularly deliver filters when needed will help ensure that filter replacement is performed on time.
			</p>
			<h4>Problem Statement</h4>
			<p> How can we help private homeowners increase the lifespan of AC units to reduce costs to maintain their properties? </p>


			<h3>02 Research</h3>
			<h4>Primary Research & Findings</h4>
			<ul>
				<li>The two most expensive systems to replace are the roof and AC/HVAC systems</li>
				<li>Costs to replace broken AC units fall entirely on the homeowner</li>
				<li><span class="highlight">Only 50% of homeowners surveyed use online systems</span> to manage their properties</li>
				<li><span class="highlight">Over 53% of tenants surveyed do not know how to change an air filter</span></li>
			</ul>

			<h4>Secondary Research</h4>
			<ul>
				<li>
					Private homeowners typically budget about 4% of their property's value in annual maintenance costs or 50% of the rental property income.
					<ul>
						<li>For a $300k home, this is between <span class="highlight">$12k-$18k per year towards maintence costs</span></li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>Basic <span class="highlight">AC units cost between $3.6k to $6k to replace</span>, higher quality units can cost upwards of $12k</li>
				<li>Common causes of AC failure include clogged air filters and lack of maintenance</li>
			</ul>

			<h3>03 Concept Development</h3>
			<h4>Personas</h4>
			<p>I created two personas to highlight some goals and pain points from homeowners and tenants, our primary users.</p>
			<p><span class="highlight">Klaus</span>, a private homeowner for 10+ years</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Has no time to monitor all of the homes he rents out</li>
				<li>Would like to reduce costs across all homes</li>
				<li>Does not regularly contact his tenants</li>
			</ul>

			<p><span class="highlight">Manfred</span>, a college student renting from Klaus</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Has lived with his parents until moving for college</li>
				<li>Does not know how to maintain a home</li>
				<li>Rarely does chores because of his busy schedule</li>
			</ul>

			<h4>User Stories</h4>
			<p>In addition to the personas, I developed user stories to guide the product concept and listed primary features needed for basic functionality.</p>
			<ol>
				<li>As a homeowner, I want to manage all my homes on a single platform</li>
				<li>As a homeowner, I want to send each property different hardware</li>
				<li>As a homeowner, I want to verify that my tenants have replaced their filter</li>
				<li>As a homeowner, I want to have a purchase history for each home to record costs</li>
			</ol>

			<h3>04 Wireframing</h3>
			<h4>User Flow Diagram</h4>

			<h4>Low-fidelity Prototypes</h4>
			<p>Each set of wireframes below illustrates one of the major user paths that can be taken.</p>

			<h3>05 Visual Design</h3>

			<h4>High-fidelity Prototypes</h4>
			<div class="prototypes-bg">
				<div class="prototypes-container">
					<div class="img-2">
						<div class="image-container img1 img-interactive" id="img1" onclick="openModal()"></div>
						<div class="image-container img2 img-interactive" id="img2"></div>				
					</div>
					<div class="img-2">
						<div class="image-container img3 img-interactive" id="img3"></div>
						<div class="image-container img4 img-interactive" id="img4"></div>
					</div>
				</div>
			</div>

			<h3>06 Testing & Validation</h3>
			<h4>Usability Tests</h4>
			<p>Several of our users included positive comments about <span class="highlight">having a clean UI, but wanting additional features</span>. Some direct quotes from these interviews can be found below:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>“It was a little unintuitive if you want to go through the steps out of order.”</li>
				<li>“It is better [than current setup] because I will not have to go to the store when it is time to change air filters and I often forget to change them as often as I should anyways.”</li>
				<li>“Could have text reminders or email alerts when it is time to change the filter.”</li>
				<li>“I think a useful feature would be an unsubscribe or delay feature.“</li>
			</ul>


			<h4>Key Takeaways</h4>
			<p> There is need to expand this application for both the benefit of homeowners and tenants. 
				These additions should include shipping additional products outside of air filters and improving communication between the homeowner and their tenants.
				The additional features requested by users during the interviews should be tested for future implementation to create a more holistic product that
				helps homeowners reduce costs across their properties.
			</p>
			<p> For future projects, I would like to be able to test several ideas with users before commiting to a solution. 
				<!-- Through this, we would be able to better identify  -->
