            <p>
                    Our game is designed to solve both the issues of difficult time
                    management and distracting games. The primary motivation for
                    addressing these issues is to find the right intervals to maximize
                    focus, while minimizing stress from studying with deadlines.
            </p>
            <p>
                    In educational environments, periods of procrastination and extended
                    work damage overall productivity. Effective studying requires
                    both freedom from distractions as well as effective time
                    budgeting. Our overall goal for the product was to create a less
                    distracting media source that would increase productivity through
                    regular use

            <h4 class="mt-0">Pomodoro Apps</h4>
            <p>
                Applications that implement Pomodoro timers are not new; there
                are many mobile applications, along with web browser extensions,
                that do this already. However, the majority of these apps are
                simple timers integrated with to-do lists and charts.
            </p>
            <p>
                In spite of the lack of diversity in Pomodoro apps, the technique itself has still
                proven to be effective in increasing productivity and it is
                important to see how it is currently being implemented. We
                looked at two popular models, Focus Booster and Focus Keeper
                Pro as case studies into existing products.
            </p>
            <h4>Idle &amp; Collecting Games</h4>
            <p>
                On the other hand, there are numerous idle and collecting games,
                but many are addictive. Idle games play themselves without user
                being present, while collection games allow users to gather game
                objects to create an inventory or accumulate points. We believed
                that idle-collecting games would be a good complement to the
                off-time in the Pomodoro technique because some games have a
                relaxing quality to them that we wanted to tap into.

            <h4 class="mt-0">Layout</h4>
            <p>
                In order to make an appealing game that would be accessible to a
                wide audience, our team decided to make the garden display the
                main focus of the interface. To bring the focus to the garden, we
                made the inventory/store menu collapsible. We used a
                drawer-style menu for listing the items in the inventory and store
                so that they could be easily browsed by the player. The menu
                itself was made with compact spacing so that more screen space
                could be allocated to showing the garden.
            </p>
            <p>
                The timer is placed in the top left position so that it is unobtrusive
                during gameplay. Once the five minute timer finishes, a
                semi-opaque black overlay is placed over the screen and the
                25-minute timer begins. This interaction indicates to the user that
                they must begin their productive cycle again, however, the game
                will still continue to run in the background.
            </p>
            <h4>Control Schema</h4>
            <p>
                The control scheme for our system is an intuitive drag-and-drop
                by mouse. Both the inventory items and the garden slots act as
                large targets for mouse clicking. The decision to maximize click
                areas allowed for faster item placement. Unoccupied garden
                slots display an orange disc to show players that an item can be
                placed. By doing this, we allow the player to check on
                the status of the garden at a glance, without needing to read text.
                To return an item to the inventory, the player only has to double
                click it in the garden. The motivation for this interaction was to
                shorten the time it takes for the player to rearrange their garden.
                Since the edition period only lasts for 5 minutes, we wanted to
                make sure that players would be able to create their arrangement
                and move on to completing their work.
            </p>
            <h4>Visual Style</h4>
            <p>
                The visual style of the game was designed to be soothing, using
                muted colours for the background and visitors to provide a
                relaxing experience. The colours of the inventory and store
                buttons are the same muted shade of orange for consistency.
                There are also icons in addition to the word labels for each button
                to be explicit about a button’s purpose. We chose a variety of
                garden visitors to illustrate and developed animations for the
                visitors when they spawn. Idle animation occurs when an object is
                not being controlled and it adds interest to the screen in a game
                like ours.

                Testing is valuable for our game if we
                aim to appeal to a wide population of users and seek to make a
                product that actually solves the two problems we have identified.
                Running user studies to test usability of our project would give us
                better understanding of the interactions we designed to influence
                future updates and improvements. As the game currently stands, it
                is more of a high-fidelity prototype than a polished final product.
                If we were to continue development, we would need to collect substantial qualitative and quantitative data.
