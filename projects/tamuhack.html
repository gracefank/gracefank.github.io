            <h4>Easy as Pie</h4>
                <p>
                	My main priority in designing the User Experience for our website was to make it easy to navigate. Without much prior user research conducted amongst hackers, I created a simple top task survey to see what hackers are looking to do most on a website.
                </p>
                <p>The breakdown is as follows:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Applying</li>
                        <li>Date/Location</li>
                        <li>Cost</li>
                        <li>Sponsors</li>
                    </ul>
                </p><br>
                <p>
                	A major challenge was identifying what information we needed on the website. Having no prior experience, I dabbled a bit into information architecture and content writing to fully explore what the user would experience. 
                </p><br>
                
            <h4>Fashion Icon</h4>
            <p>
				The website is our first point of contact between us and our hackers. For the past four years, our users have known us by a blue and pink colour scheme. Therefore, to maintain this consistency and familiarity, I continued to base the designs around these colours.
            </p>
            <div class="figure">

            </div>
            <p>
            	One goal of TAMUhack this year is to increase our campus involvement outside of our main event. To emphasise this goal, I created graphics using various parts of our campus, such as our Academic Building and our school’s mascot. Additionally, these graphics are meant to portray TAMUhack as fun, approachable, and open for all. Hopefully by now, the UI is coming together as something memorable to hackers.

            <br>

            <h4>Stack Overflow</h4>
            <p>
				TAMUhack is small for a hackathon organization, with only 14 active members. Although we lack in manpower, we are proudest of our friendly and supportive relationship with one another. We just simply have to be creative when allocating work so that not one single person is overwhelmed.
            </p>
        </div>  
    </div>

    <div class="row content-pg">

        <div class="col-lg-6 offset-lg-1">
            <h4>Navigate &amp; Explore</h4>
            <p>
				To make navigating our website as easy as pie, I broke up the website flow into two components: infinite scroll and and pages. 
			</p>
			<div class="figure">
                <img src="../assets/tamuhack-wireframe.png">
                <h6>Fig. 3 TAMUhack Navigation Bar</h6>
            </div>
            <p>
				The infinite scroll was implemented because it is a common style used amongst hackathon websites, making it familiar to users. It displays a lot of information, but I organised it by adding a sticky navigation bar so people can easily jump between sections.
			</p>

			<p>
				I wanted pages to be implemented, too, because there is non-essential information, such as team member introductions and TAMU-only student events, that do not need to be displayed to everyone. It makes exploring the rest of the site voluntary and exciting by hiding Easter Egg graphics.  
			</p>
			<p>
				Some features I wanted to highlight were the sections identified in the top task survey. Those sections are all placed in the navigation bar for easy access and “Apply” is designed as a button to really stand out. Because I have to keep in mind that some students are seasoned hackers, they may not want to explore the site and only want to apply. For these users, the button is always prominently displayed to prevent them from being deterred to apply. 
            </p>

            </div>

            <h4>Divide &amp; Conquer</h4>
            <p>
				Despite being short-handed, we found a great way to balance work as a development team. Although I would love to learn React, I am the only designer on the team and spend most of my time creating prototypes for the dev team. Our flow works well because when I have a new component or page designed, one or two people step up to take it on. Then I have one-on-one sessions with each developer to make adjustments.
			</p>
			<p>
				One aspect I love is that I am a requested reviewer on pull requests and can create as many issues as my heart desires! I am grateful for studying Computer Science as I am still heavily involved with the development process, despite not pushing too much code.
            </p><br>
            <h4>Hack Parties</h4>
            <p>
				What do hackers do best? We indulge ourselves on pizza and caffeine, bring out whiteboards and markers, and hack the night away! While we formally meet once a week, we host optional hacking “parties” on the weekends where we work on outreach, web development, and graphic design together. Because what’s better than working on an amazing project with people you love?
			</p>
			<p>	
				It’s also during these times when we are most productive because we can bounce ideas and problems off of one another. These parties really emulate the hacker experience and what we are trying to create for our community.

            <h4>Social Media</h4>
            <p>
				In addition to our website, we are putting in the extra effort this year to develop a hacker community at Texas A&amp;M University. We believe that the best ideas are born when a diverse set of people work together on projects that make them excited. Therefore, we are increasing our social media presence by launching ‘Hacker Highlight’, a campaign that interviews current hackers and what makes them passionate.

            <h4>Branding</h4>
            <p>
				To create somewhat of a lasting legacy, I want to make a consistent brand for TAMUhack. If someone sees or hears TAMUhack, they should imagine our logos, our colours, our branding. This effort will likely take place in social media updates, creating more merchandise for both organisers and hackers, as well as just maintaining consistency transitioning between each year’s designs.
