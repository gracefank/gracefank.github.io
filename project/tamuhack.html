                            <p>
                                TAMUhack is Texas A&M's largest annual hackathon that takes place in January. We host workshops throughout the semester and are a diverse group of engineers who brought our passions together to bring you a space for creative expression and collaboration! </p>
                            <p>
                                I lead the design initiative as the Design Director and my responsibilities have included mapping website interactions, developing website prototypes, and designing web, social media, and merchandise graphics.

                            <h3>Challenges</h3>
                            <h4>Easy as Pie</h4>
                                <p>My main priority in designing the User Experience for our website was to make it easy to navigate. Without much prior user research conducted amongst hackers, I created a simple top task survey to see what hackers are looking to do most on a website.</p>
                                <p>The breakdown is as follows:
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Applying</li>
                                        <li>Date/Location</li>
                                        <li>Cost</li>
                                        <li>Sponsors</li>
                                    </ul>
                                </p><br>
                                
                            <h4>Fashion Icon</h4>
                            <p>
                                The website serves as the first point of contact between us and our hackers. In terms of UI design, I wanted to create something that represented our campus. Thus, I recreated our Academic Building in Adobe Illustrator as well as several other fun graphics. For the past four years, we have had one consistent theme: blue and pink.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                However, we know that the current generation is nothing without our cute animals and memes. Therefore, to become #relatable, I added our school’s mascot as well as Bitmojis of all of our organisers. Hopefully by now, the UI is coming together as something memorable to hackers.
                            </p><br>
                            <h4>Stack Overflow</h4>
                            <p>
                                TAMUhack is small for a hackathon organization, boasting only 14 active members. Although we are lacking in manpower, we are most proud of our friendly and supportive relationship with one another. We just simply have to be creative when allocating work so that not one single person is overwhelmed!
                            </p>

                    <div class="row margin">
                        <div class="col-sm-12">
                            <h3>Approach</h3>
                            <h4>Navigate &amp; Explore</h4>
                            <h4>Divide &amp; Conquer</h4>
                            <p>
                                Despite being short-handed, we found a great way to balance work amongst a development team. Although I would love to learn development in React, I am the only designer on the team and spend most of my time creating prototypes for the dev team. However, one aspect I love is that I get put as reviewer on pull requests and can create as many issues as my heart desires!
                            </p><br>
                            <h4>Hack Parties</h4>
                            <p>
                                What do hackers do best? We indulge ourselves on pizza and caffeine, bring out whiteboards and markers, and hack the night away! While we meet once a week, we host optional hacking “parties” on the weekends where we work on outreach, web development, and graphic design together. Because what’s better than working on an amazing project with people you love?

                    <a name="results"></a>
                    <div class="row margin">
                        <div class="col-sm-12">
                            <h3>Results</h3>
                            <h4>Website</h4>
                            <p>While we are currently still updating our website with content and new features, a great product can already be viewed <a href="http://tamuhack.com/">here</a>! </p><br>
                            <h4>Social Media</h4>
                            <p>In addition to our website, we are putting in the extra effort this year to develop a hacker community at Texas A&amp;M University. We believe that the best ideas are born when a diverse set of people work together on projects that make them excited. Therefore, we are increasing our social media presence by launching ‘Hacker Highlight’, a campaign that interviews current hackers and what makes them passionate.</p><br>
                            <h4>Branding</h4>
                            <p>
                                As somewhat of a lasting legacy, I also want to create a consistent brand for TAMUhack so if someone sees or hears TAMUhack they’ll think of a specific image. This effort will likely take place in social media updates, creating more merchandise for both organisers and hackers, as well as just maintaining consistency between each year’s designs.
