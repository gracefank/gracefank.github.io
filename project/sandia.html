                            <p>
                                Sandia National Laboratories is a research and development laboratory focused on nuclear and national security. At Sandia, I worked as a User Experience Design intern at Sandia, where I developed high-fidelity prototypes and conducted usability tests for different content types. I also researched existing pattern libraries and typographic scales through online databases and eye-tracking studies to design UI components for the company’s intranet.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                To comply with my non-disclosure agreement, I have omitted and obfuscated confidential information presented here. All information presented here is my own and does not necessarily reflect the views of Sandia.

                            <h3>Challenges</h3>
                            <h4>Link Farmville</h4>
                            <p>
                                One of the largest issues Sandia’s intranet faces is the amount of content and resources they provide to their employees. My main focus was to work with another designer to manage and organise all of this information on a website.
                            </p>
                            <h4>Accessibility</h4> 
                            <p>
                                When designing a pattern library, a huge aspect is making your designs accessible. This includes thinking about the vision impaired, colour-blind, and keyboard-accessible design. 
                            </p>
                            <h4>Need vs. Want</h4> 
                            <p>
                                Lastly, since Sandia’s User Experience teams are still in the early stages of development, it was important to prioritise needs and wants. There were many features we wanted to implement that would have created a better user experience, however, we had to choose specific features and first create a minimum viable product.
                            </p>

                    <a name="approach"></a>
                    <div class="row margin">
                        <div class="col-sm-12">
                            <h3>Approach</h3>
                            <h4>Affinity Diagramming</h4>
                            <p>
                                While working with the UX team, I helped brainstorm and organise design ideas through affinity diagrams. This process consisted of a sea of colour-coordinated sticky-notes and a lot of restructuring.
                            </p>
                            <h4>Iterative Design</h4>
                            <p>
                                For both component design and the prototype, I went through numerous design reviews and pull requests. I coded live for the designer where we implemented UI changes immediately.
                            </p>
                            <h4>Information Architecture</h4> 
                            <p>
                                Another key step to organising all the content was literally organising all the content. Because of the sheer amount of content, it was important to cut down where possible and make it readable to everyone.

                        <div class="col-sm-12">
                            <h3>Results</h3>
                            <h4>High-Fidelity Prototype</h4>
                            <p>
                                I also developed a high-fidelity prototype in HTML & SASS for a new intranet design. Unfortunately, images are unavailable.
                            </p>
                            <h4>Pattern Library Components</h4>
                            <p>
                                By the end of the internship, I designed 4 new components for the intranet: accordions, cards, carousels, and modals. 
                            </p>
                            <h4>Topic Papers</h4>
                            <p>
                                I also conducted research and wrote topic papers on typography, eye-tracking studies, and atomic design.
